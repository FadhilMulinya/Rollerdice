# Dice Rolling Game

This C++ project simulates rolling a pair of dice. When run, it generates two random numbers representing the values of the dice. This simple game can be run entirely on the command line.

## Getting Started
### Clone the Repository

To clone this repository to your local machine, open your terminal and run the following command:
```
 git clone git@github.com:FadhilMulinya/Rollerdice.git 
```

### Prerequisites

To compile and run this project, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can use GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) or any other C++ compiler that supports C++11 or higher.

### Compiling the Code

To compile the code, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

### Compiling the game
```
  gcc main.cpp
```
This command compiles the source code (`main.cpp`) and generates an executable file named `dice_game`.

### Running the Game

After compiling the code, you can run the game by executing the generated executable:


This will simulate rolling a pair of dice and display the two results on the command line.

## Future Plans

As part of the project roadmap, I plan to deploy this dice rolling game as a decentralized application (DApp) on a blockchain platform. By leveraging blockchain technology, players can enjoy a trustless and transparent gaming experience where the outcome of each roll is verifiable on the blockchain.

Stay tuned for updates as I work on implementing the game as a DApp!
